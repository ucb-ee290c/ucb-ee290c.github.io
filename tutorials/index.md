## Software

[Setting Up RISC-V Environment](software/setting-up-riscv-environment.md) - a little out of date as of May 2025.

## Baremetal IDE

[Baremetal IDE Getting Started Lab](baremetal-ide/Baremetal-IDE-Lab.md) - created Fall 2024, still accurate May 2025.

Checkout the rest of the main website for more Baremetal IDE references.

[Baremetal From The Ground Up](software/baremetal-from-the-ground-up.md) - there's more good baremetal content, but you need to search for the sources on the main website (and maybe PR to here).

Checkout the more recent EE194 Tapeout Labs linked from the main website for a more comprehensive overview.
