# Tutorials

Below are some highlights, some not in the sidebar. 

## Software

[Setting Up RISC-V Environment](software/setting-up-riscv-environment.md) - a little out of date as of May 2025.

## Baremetal IDE

[Baremetal IDE Getting Started Lab](baremetal-ide/Baremetal%20IDE%20Lab.md) - created Fall 2024, still accurate May 2025.

Checkout the rest of the bring-up website for more Baremetal IDE references.

[Baremetal From The Ground Up](software/baremetal-from-the-ground-up.md) - there's more good baremetal content, but you need to search for the sources on the bring-up website (and maybe PR to here).

## Chipyard

[Chipyard Getting Started Guide](chipyard/chipyard-lab/index.md) - 2023.

Checkout the more recent EE194 Tapeout Labs for a more comprehensive overview. 
(But some are only internally accessible on BWRC GitLab.)
