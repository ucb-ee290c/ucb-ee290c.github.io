### Statement on Academic Misconduct

Any test, paper, or report submitted by you and that bears your name is presumed to be your own original work that has not been previously submitted for credit in another course unless you obtain prior written approval to do so from your instructor.

In all of your assignments, including your homework or drafts of papers, you may use words or ideas written by other individuals in publications, websites, or other sources, but only with proper attribution. “Proper attribution” means that you have fully identified the original source and extent of your use of the words or ideas of others that you reproduce in your work for this course, usually in the form of a footnote or parenthesis.

As a general rule, if you are citing from a published source or from a website and the quotation is short (up to a sentence or two), place it in quotation marks; if you employ a longer passage from a publication or website, please indent it and use single spacing. In both cases, be sure to cite the original.

If you are not clear about the expectations for completing an assignment or taking a test or examination, be sure to seek clarification from your instructor or GSI beforehand.

Finally, you should keep in mind that as a member of the campus community, you are expected to demonstrate integrity in all of your academic endeavors and will be evaluated on your own merits. So be proud of your academic accomplishments and help to protect and promote academic integrity at Berkeley. The consequences of cheating and academic dishonesty — receiving an academic penalty for the assignment or for the class, receiving conduct and educational sanctions, or being asked to disclose your conduct history on a graduate school, law school, medical school, or dental school application — are simply not worth it.
