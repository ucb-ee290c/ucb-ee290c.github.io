### Statement on DSP Accomendation

UC Berkeley is committed to creating a learning environment that meets the needs of its diverse student body. If you anticipate or experience any barriers to learning in this course, please feel welcome to discuss your concerns with me.

If you have a disability, or think you may have a disability, you can work with the Disabled Students' Program (DSP) to request an official accommodation. The Disabled Students' Program (DSP) is the campus office responsible for authorizing disability-related academic accommodations, in cooperation with the students themselves and their instructors. There are approximately 5,000 students at Cal who receive services from the DSP.  The majority are students with nonapparent or invisible disabilities. You can find more information about DSP, including contact information and the application process here: dsp.berkeley.edu. 

I encourage students with disabilities to have a conversation with me about your access accommodations even if you have already had DSP send me a letter. Accommodation letters do not always take into account the particularities of every class, so I encourage you to communicate any issue you have or anticipate having this semester. Even if you don’t have access issues with this class, consider a conversation with me as practice for conversations you may have with other professors or in a job interview. Also, suggestions you have about making this class more accessible for you will potentially make it more accessible and inclusive for everyone.

Students who need academic accommodations or have questions about their accommodations should contact DSP, located at 260 César Chávez Student Center. Students may call 510-642-0518 (voice), 510-642-6376 (TTY), or email dsp@berkeley.edu.
